This project focuses on creating a Power BI dashboard for HR professionals using a three-month employee attendance dataset. 
The process includes thorough data cleaning, Power BI setup, data import, Power Query transformations (including column unpivoting and parameter usage), DAX implementation for calculated columns and measures, and the utilization of various charts, filters, and slicers for effective visualization. 
The result is an interactive dashboard enabling HR to gain insights into remote work percentages, sick leave patterns, and absenteeism trends. The emphasis is on both technical aspects and practical usability for HR decision-making.
